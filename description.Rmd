## Motivation and Overview
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America that draws the attention of many basketball fans all over the world. During the regular season, each of the 30 teams (15 in the Eastern Conference and 15 in the Western Conference) plays 82 games. At the conclusion of the regular season, the top eight teams in each conference advance to the playoffs for a chance to compete for the championship title. Towards the end of the regular season, the race for the final few playoff spots are very intense, and usually it isn't until the final game of the regular season is over when we know which teams have made the cut. As NBA fans ourselves, we are eager to find out which teams will make the playoffs this year (2019-20 NBA season), but rather than wait until next April, as data analysts, we thought it would be interesting if we could make such predictions now. We hope our analysis will lead to meaningful insights that will be of interest to NBA fans all over the world. 

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the winning percentages of the NBA teams in the Western Conference, and thus the playoff teams (the eight teams with the highest winning percentages). In addition to overall winning percentages, we will also provide predicted winning percentages for home games and for away games for each team.

We will undergo a comprehensive background study of the NBA to manually decide on what features to use. Then feature learning techniques will be applied. We also plan to evaluate different models. A successful model will predict the 2019-2020 NBA playoffs in the Western Conference. Ideally, the model could also be trained to predict the playoff teams in the Eastern Conference and finally round-by-round playoff predictions.



## Related Work and Literature Review

### Playoff Prediction 
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-predictions/

### Pair-comparison data
Bradeley-Terry model

## Data 

### Data Source
The data will be collected from Basketball Reference website. The database contains player statistics since 1946, including points per game, assists per game, rebounds per game, etc,. The database also provides team statistics, including 3 point percentages, winning percentages, etc,. 

### Data Scraping 
We used `rvest` package to scrape the following data from Basketball Reference website:

* `team_stats`: The team statistics of first 20 games from season 2016-17 to 2019-20. We would use these data to define the team performance during specific season in the feature engineering section.

* `game_stats`: The game results (W-L record and scores) for each of the remaining 62 games from season 2016-17 to 2018-19. We would use these data in the mode building section. 

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
team_stats = readr::read_csv("./data/team_stats_all.csv")
game_stats = readr::read_csv("./data/game_stats_all.csv")
head(team_stats)
head(game_stats)

```

We did not include the code for web scraping in this rmarkdown file in order to save the runtime. You can check the `data_scraping.R` file in the source folder for more details. Here we just showed the first few rows of the data. 

### Data Wrangling
Data wrangling would be performed throughout the whole data analysis process covering data tidying, EDA, feature engineering, and model building. Here we demonstrated some necessary data wrangling procedures which were prepared for further analysis.

## Feature Engineering
The performance of a team could be captured by both the team-level and player-level statistics. The team-level features that could be included in our current model were:
* number of W and L, W/L percentage, conference rank
* team total/average points, oppponent total/average points
* other secondary statistics

The player-level features that could be incorporated in the team performance metrics were

* number of league top (50-100) win share players in the team
* highest win share value in the team
